A friend that keeps you on your toes.

# Project Description
 A Tingo is a friend on your phone.  Similar to a Tamagotchi, you need to take care of it with exercise, meals, and sleep.  Tingos do everything with you so if you're sleeping, then they are too.  This encourages users to eat healthy, go to the gym and get enough sleep.  Healthy Tingos can level up and get items.
 Tingos will be able to understand what you say and follow basic instructions using our own speech recognition algorithm.  Eventually, Tingos will be able to hold a basic conversation.
# Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
 The minimal viable product for this app will include:
  - A UI where users can see their Tingo and its health stats
  - Connectivity with Google and Apple fit API's to track steps, affecting Tingo health
  - Speech recognition with TensorFlow
  - Performing actions based off of what was said
  - App created through Unity that will be on IOS and Android

# Add-on Features
 - Tracking sleep and diet to effect Tingo health
 - Basic conversation with the Tingo
 - Collectable items and wearables earned from leveling up

 # User Story

When the user opens the app, they will be able to see their Tingo and its health.  It's health is linked to the number of steps the user has taken that day.  If the user does not hit enough steps, the Tingo will lose health until it dies, at which point they can make a new Tingo.  If the user goes over their step amount, the Tingo will gain XP and can level up.

It will also be possible to talk to the Tingo and have it react to the words that the user says.  It can make noises or move around the room based off user voice input.
